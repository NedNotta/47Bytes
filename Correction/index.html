      <h1>Differences In Spelling</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>There are many words in the world that have multiple meanings with the only
      thing separating them is spelling, Here are some of the most mixed up ones.
      <br>
      <h3>There, Their and They're</h3>
      I will be honest, I have messed these ones up a few times but that doesn't 
      change that it can be annoying or even change the whole meaning of the 
      text. <br>Here are their meanings;<br><br>
      <span class='Special'>There</span> -- Referring to a location, Ex. "They are over <span class='Special'>there</span>!"
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>Their</span> -- Referring to possession, Ex. "That is <span class='Special'>Their</span> car!"
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>They're</span> -- Means "They -- Are", Ex. "<span class='Special'>They're</span> over there!"
      <br><br><hr><br>
      <h3>Your and You're</h3>
      I rarely mess these up but some people do, Here is the correct use and meaning;
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>Your</span> -- Referring to possession, Ex. "Is that <span class='Special'>Your</span> car?"
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>You're</span> -- Means "You -- Are", Ex. "<span class='Special'>You're</span> crazy!"
      <br><br><hr><br>
      <h3>To, Too and Two</h3>
      I used to get these mixed up, But here are their meanings:
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>To</span> -- Referring to a location, Ex. "I'm going <span class='Special'>to</span> the store; Need anything?"
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>Too</span> -- Alternate word for "Also", Ex. "You're going to see the movie <span class='Special'>too</span>?"
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>Two</span> -- The number "2", Ex. "You need <span class='Special'>two</span> shoes to leave the house, John."
      <br><br><hr><br>
      <h3>Through and Threw</h3>
      I don't get these mixed up normally but here are the meanings;
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>Through</span> -- Referring to movement or length of time, Ex. "We have to go <span class='Special'>through</span> the tunnel on the left"
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>Threw</span> -- Referring to the movement of an object, Ex. "I <span class='Special'>threw</span> the garbage out properly"
      <br><br><hr><br>
      <h3>A &amp; An</h3>
      These words are a little different, But they have the same meaning but are used in different places, To explain fully I suggest checking out one of my sources at the bottom. <br>I will try my best to get this correct, You use "an" instead of "a" when the next word begins with a vowel<br>Unless it isn't pronounced with a vowel, For example "He is an actor." has "an", but "She has a euro." has "a" because it is pronounced "yu-or" (Y doesn't count) but you would put "an" in "I only have an hour for lunch." because "hour" is pronounced like "a-er" and "a" is a vowel
      <br><br><hr><br>
      <h3>Affect and Effect</h3>
      Here are the meanings;
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>Affect</span> -- To influence something, Ex. "Downed Power Line <span class='Special'>Affects</span> PNM Customers"
      <br><br>
      <span class='Special'>Effect</span> -- Referring to result, Ex. "The overall <span class='Special'>effect</span> was surprising."

    <!-- Differences In Spelling End -->
    <!-- Apostrophe or Not Start -->
    
    <div id='AorN'>
      <h1>Apostrophe or Not?</h1>
      <hr>
      Normally an Apostrophe means it replaced a letter; With that said there are some alternate meanings or alternate ways of using them.
      <br><br><hr><br>
      Examples of apostrophes being used:
      <br><br>
      "<span class='Special'>John's</span> house is very impressive eh?" -- Used for possession
      <br><br>
      "I could really go for some Bangers <span class='Special'>'n'</span> Mash" -- Used as replacement
      <br><br>
      "<span class='Special'>Phyllis'</span> car is in the shop today" -- Used for possesion (Put "<span class='Special'>'</span>" instead of "<span class='Special'>'s</span>" when the name ends in a "s"
      <br><br>
      "I would like some <span class='Special'>'tatoes</span> <span class='Special'>'n'</span> spinach my dear" -- Used as replacement
    </div>
