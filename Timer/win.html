It could also cause a problem if you send a countdown to a friend that is in a diffrent time zone as you<br>Example. You create a countdown under 24 hours, You send it to your friend 24 hours ahead of you, Upon opening the timer has already expired for them.<br>To prevent this make sure you and the person you are sending the count down too are in valid time zones. <br>Another set back to this is your in-device clock might be wrong, And that will cause some problems. As always thanks for using something I made -ned</p></body></html>
